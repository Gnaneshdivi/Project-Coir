**Inspiration:** It was an incident whcih inspired us to come up with an idea like this.There is an old couple in our relatives who had suffered a lot from filing a case against a son of a politician.The son of politician made an accident which resulted to servere injuries of a person walking on the road.He is the son of tgh couple that I mentioned before.Politician sun was drunk when drove the car.The couple filed a law suit against the politician son in which they lost.They were so asd that justice is not possible in India.While listening to this  I had a thought of "Is it the situation of thousands of cases filed daily in our country?".Adding to that there are around 45 lakh pendng cases in just the highcourts of the country.We need a transparent way to track and store all the data.When a case is filed in a police station ,all the involved people will not get the status of case and in which stage the case is.In India different types of cases of different steps.And each step has different procedures which are important for the people involved to understand.There is not a perfect way to do that.There are also cases which are transferres from one court ot other .There is not a transparent way to do that.There were many cases in which the cases have been manipulated to give the false hearings by changing the data and proofs.There were may cases that a corrupted official tampered the data which resulted in injustice to the right people. As a solution for all these problems and manymore we use **blockchain technology** as a transparent solution.The name of this project **LAWBOOK**
