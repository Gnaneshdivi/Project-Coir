**Inspiration:** It was an incident whcih inspired us to come up with an idea like this.There is an old couple in our relatives who had suffered a lot from filing a case against a son of a politician.The son of politician made an accident which resulted to servere injuries of a person walking on the road.He is the son of tgh couple that I mentioned before.Politician sun was drunk when drove the car.The couple filed a law suit against the politician son in which they lost.They were so asd that justice is not possible in India.While listening to this  I had a thought of "Is it the situation of thousands of cases filed daily in our country?".Adding to that there are around 45 lakh pendng cases in just the highcourts of the country.We need a transparent way to track and store all the data.When a case is filed in a police station ,all the involved people will not get the status of case and in which stage the case is.In India different types of cases of different steps.And each step has different procedures which are important for the people involved to understand.There is not a perfect way to do that.There are also cases which are transferres from one court ot other .There is not a transparent way to do that.There were many cases in which the cases have been manipulated to give the false hearings by changing the data and proofs.There were may cases that a corrupted official tampered the data which resulted in injustice to the right people. As a solution for all these problems and manymore we use **blockchain technology** as a transparent solution.The name of this project **LAWBOOK**
      

**What it does:** We used block chain technology to create an application that can be used by both citizens and officials.All the data entered from begining of a lawsuit to the ending of the lawsuit is stored amd maintained using blockchain technology.There will be two interfaces.One is citizen interface and another is official's interface.A person or a group of people can file a lawsuit in the police station or the court directly depending on the the case.The officials will file the lawsuit and upload all the information given by the citizens and generate a unique identification token based on date,time and location for that particular law suit.The person can use this token to know the status of the lawsuit he/she filed.Along the time when case goes through different steps,each step and procedure will be uploaded.The person who filed the lawsuit can track the status of the lawsuit using the token.We use blockchain to store the data.Through this the data is more secure and robust.The data cannot be manipulated and there is no chance of tampering.We can also reduce the usage of paper which helps the environment.Data monitoring becomes easy as its digital.If a change has to be done in the data only authorised personnel can do that with a proper explanation.


**How is it differnt from before solutions:** Now a days lawsuits that are filed in policestations and courts are digitalised, but not completely.They dont upload all the information regarding the lawsuit and data can be manipulated easily.With our project we are solving this problem using blockchain technology.We can also reduce the corruption in the department of law and order.In India its an open truth that due to corruption many lives were lost and injustice happened to many people.This project can help with all of these issues.


How it does these things:








**Challenges we ran into:** 
1-One of the challenges we ran into was token generation.Because we arenot generating randomized tokens.The token generated are based on the date,time and the location.Almost every part of the country comes under the range of any oone policestation.Based on this we generate tokens.
2-Another challenge we faced was integrating an application with blockchain.Its a complex netwrok and the two interfaces has to be differentiated.
